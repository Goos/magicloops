## Acknowledgements

This tutorial makes use of a [modified submodule](https://github.com/jmausolf/magicloops), originally forked from @rayidghani [magicloops](https://github.com/rayidghani/magicloops). It has been updated to run in Python2 or Python3. In addition, my modified fork modifies the plotting code and several of the functions to take a user-specified dataset, outcome variable, and features.
